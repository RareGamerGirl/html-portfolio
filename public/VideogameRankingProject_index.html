<h1>The Best Videogames According to Tye</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>


<!--Bloodborne-->
<h3>Bloodborne</h3>
<p>
    Developed by FromSoftware <br/>
    Produced by Sony 
</p>
<p>
    FromSoftware is my favorite devloper. <br/>
    I've tried-out or beaten many of their intense and challenging games, but the one that I and many others believe is their opus, is Bloodborne. <br/>
    However....it's not on PC...

<!--The Witcher 3-->
<h3>The Witcher 3</h3>
<p>
    Developed by CD Projekt RED <br/>
    Produced by CD Projekt
</p>
<p>
    The Witcher 3 may be the most creatively inspiring game I've ever played. <br/>
    And Blood and Wine, the DLC, might quite possibly be the best DLC ever made for a videogame. It is in my mind atleast.

<!--Mount and Blade-->
<h3>Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord</h3>
<p>
    Developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment <br/>
